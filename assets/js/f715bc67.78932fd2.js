I\'m still working on it, but i was feeling the need to do something else.\\nSo i decided to get back to my GitOps project and to do some cleanup and upgrade.\\n\\n## Automate me\\n\\nWho\'s turn ? it\'s [Wireguard\'s](https://www.wireguard.com/) turn to be automated with... terraform again. I\'m starting to like this tool, it\'s really easy to use and to understand. And it\'s really powerfull. So what does the automation and upgrade does ?\\n\\n- Create the Wireguard configuration (Peer, Interface, ...)\\n- Create a secret with each peer (Server, Client1, ...)\\n- Include AdGuard Home and the hability to access the Kubernetes internal DNS.\\n- Build my own image of Wireguard to handle exposing metrics to Prometheus.\\n\\n### Upgrade\\n\\nIn order to facilitate my upgrade process, i setup [Renovate](https://www.mend.io/renovate/) to handle the upgrade of my dependencies. It\'s really easy to use and it\'s working really well. I just need to execute the renovate job daily and it create PR when needed and merge it when i think it\'s ok.\\n\\nWell we need everything to be up to date, so i upgraded everything to the latest version available like\\n\\n- Terraform Zitadel from v1.0.0-alpha.18 to v1.0.0-alpha.19\\n- Terraform Harbor from v3.9.4 to v3.10.1\\n- Terraform Kubernetes from v2.22.0 to v2.23.0\\n- Helm Release Loki from v4.6.1 to v5.14.1\\n- Helm Release Tempo from v1.3.1 to v1.5.0\\n- Helm Release Postgres from v12.6.5 to v12.8.3\\n- Helm Release Redis from v17.13.2 to v17.15.5\\n- Container Buildkit from v0.10.6 to v0.12.1 (and caching with harbor)\\n\\nWhile working on the upgrade part, i ended up thinking that setting up Changelog would be a good thing. So i\'m thinking of including [cog](https://docs.cocogitto.io/).\\n\\n### Next to do\\n\\n- [ ] Setup Changelog\\n- [ ] Setup Cog\\n- [ ] Automate Sonarqube [#52](https://github.com/batleforc/WeeboGitOps/issues/52) that would end the automation of Zitadel [#44](https://github.com/batleforc/WeeboGitOps/issues/44)\\n\\nWhile i was upgrading everything it become obvious that i need to upgrade my use of Github. Then i moved from the old Github Dashboard to [the new one](https://github.com/users/batleforc/projects/7/views/1). Event if i wasn\'t writing the doc, i was still working on the project and updating the dashboard and issues."},{"id":"one-year-later","metadata":{"permalink":"/WeeboGitOps/blog/one-year-later","editUrl":"https://github.com/batleforc/WeeboGitOps/tree/Doc/Main/blog/2023-07-29-v3.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-29-v3.md","title":"One year later","description":"Well it\'s been a little more than a year since the last post.

If you are reading this, thank you for your interest in my blog about the GitOps project. I hope you will find it useful.\\n\\n## What\'s new\\n\\nhmmm... Everything ? In the past few day, i just graduated from my Master degree, and just got my first job out of studie.\\nThis project never stopped, but i didn\'t have enough time to write about it.\\n\\nThe goal is stil the same, having a fully automated kubernetes cluster, with a GitOps approach. Will following some Good practice.\\n\\n### Auth me now\\n\\nOne of the most nerf wrecking change was to kick out the old auth system [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) and replace it with [Zitadel](https://zitadel.com/).\\n\\nWhy the change ? Zitadel bring the hability to [fully automate](https://github.com/users/batleforc/projects/7/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=34063201) (except SAML) the auth process and to create each application with a terraform \\"CronJob\\".\\n\\nThe pros of automating the auth process is that you dont need to create each thing by hand, and you can easily create a new application with a simple terraform file. And you are sure that whats automated will be the source of truth thought time.\\n\\nAt the moment i didn\'t find any cons, except for the huge amout of ram that [CochroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) need to run when considering Keycloak use Postgresql. (The saml part is not a cons, it\'s just not implemented yet).\\n\\n### Automate me\\n\\nWith the new auth system, i was able to automate the oidc setup for each application. But by discovering Zitadel, i also discoverd [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).\\n\\nIt allow me to:\\n\\n- Automate the oidc setup for each application (Grafana, Gitea, Harbor, WIP: Sonarqube, Oauth2Proxy, ...)\\n- Automate Harbor (Project, Robot account, Configuration, ...)\\n- Automate some simple step (creation of Kubeconfig)\\n- Automate Sonarqube (WIP)\\n- Automate Minio (WIP)\\n\\n### Upgrade\\n\\nWell we need everything to be up to date, so i upgraded everything to the latest version available like\\n\\n- Gitea (need to be done manually, because each upgrade break everything) (1.18 -> 1.20)\\n- Tekton (Just an upgrade of the CRD)\\n- Harbor (automated)\\n- Haproxy (0.14.2 -> 0.14.4)\\n- CertManager\\n- Tempo (replace Jaeger because it\'s easier to use)\\n- Flux (0.41.2 -> 2.0.1)\\n\\n### Next to do\\n\\nWhile i was upgrading everything it become obvious that i need to upgrade my use of Github. Then i moved from the old Github Dashboard to [the new one](https://github.com/users/batleforc/projects/7/views/1).
