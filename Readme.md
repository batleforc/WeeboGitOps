flux bootstrap github --owner=batleforc --repository=WeeboGitOps --path=./clusters --personal --branch=main

## Folow up ?

The project use the github projects and has a board that help to follow the work in progress [url of the board](https://github.com/batleforc/WeeboGitOps/projects/1).

The version setup on this repo is a pretty old one, lot's of thing have moved but ATM it's not secure enought for me to publish it to te public. if you may need help i'm available on every network.
